</div>
<article>
    <div class="paragraph">Britain is a fantastic place to live: a modern, thriving society with a long and illustrious history. Our people have been at the heart of the world’s political, scientific, industrial and cultural development. We are proud of our record of welcoming new migrants who will add to the diversity and dynamism of our national life.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Applying to become a permanent resident or citizen of the UK is an important decision and commitment. You will be agreeing to accept the responsibilities which go with permanent residence and to respect the laws, values and traditions of the UK. Good citizens are an asset to the UK. We welcome those seeking to make a positive contribution to our society.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Passing the Life in the UK Test is part of demonstrating that you are ready to become a permanent migrant to the UK.</div>
    <h3 class="subheader">The Values and Principles of the UK</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">British society is founded on fundamental values and principles which all those living in the UK should respect and support. These values are reflected in the responsibilities, rights and privileges of being a British citizen or permanent resident of the UK. They are based on history and traditions and are protected by law, customs and expectations. There is no place in British society for extremism or intolerance.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        The fundamental principles of British life include:
        <ul>
            <li>Democracy</li>
            <li>The rule of law</li>
            <li>Individual liberty</li>
            <li>Tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs</li>
            <li>Participation in community life</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">As part of the citizenship ceremony, new citizens pledge to uphold these values. The pledge is:</div>
    <blockquote class="quote" style="white-space: pre-wrap">‘I will give my loyalty to the United Kingdom and respect its rights and freedoms. I will uphold its democratic values. I will observe its laws faithfully and fulfil my duties and obligations as a British citizen.’</blockquote>
    <div class="paragraph">
        Following from the fundamental principles are responsibilities and freedoms which are shared by all those living in the UK and which we expect all residents to respect.
        <ul>
            <li>respect and obey the law</li>
            <li>respect the rights of others, including their right to their own opinions</li>
            <li>treat others with fairness</li>
            <li>look after yourself and your family</li>
            <li>look after the area in which you live and the environment</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        In return, the UK offers:
        <ul>
            <li>freedom of belief and religion</li>
            <li>freedom of speech</li>
            <li>freedom from unfair discrimination</li>
            <li>a right to a fair trial</li>
            <li>a right to join in the election of a government</li>
        </ul>

    <h3 class="subheader">1.1 Becoming a Permanent Resident</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
        To apply to become a permanent resident or citizen of the UK, you will need to:
        <ul>
            <li>speak and read English</li>
            <li>have a good understanding of life in the UK.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        There are currently (as of January 2013) two ways you can be tested on these requirements:
        <ul>
            <li>Take the Life in the UK test. The questions are written in a way that requires an understanding of the English language at English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) Entry Level 3, so there is no need to take a separate English language test. People here on work visas, including those on Tier 1 and Tier 2 of the points based system, normally must pass the Life in the UK test to become permanent residents.</li>
            <li>Pass an ESOL course in English with Citizenship. You will need to take this course if your standard of English is below ESOL Entry Level 3. The course will help you to improve your English and learn more about life in the UK. At the end of the course you will take a test.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        Once you have passed one of these tests, you can make an application for permanent residence or British citizenship. The form that you have to complete and the evidence that you need to provide will depend on your personal circumstances. There is a fee for submitting an application, which is different for the various types of application. All of the forms and a list of fees can be found on the UK Border Agency website, <a href="http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk</a>. From October 2013, the requirements will change. From that date, for settlement or permanent residence, you will need to:
        <ul>
            <li>Pass the Life in the UK test</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="paragraph">AND</div>
        <ul>
            <li>Produce acceptable evidence of speaking and listening skills in English at B1 of the Common European Framework of Reference. This is equivalent to ESOL Entry Level 3.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">The requirements for citizenship applications may also change in the future. Further details will be published on the UK Border Agency website and you should check the information on that website for current requirements before applying for settlement or citizenship.</div>
